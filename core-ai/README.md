# Core AI (ED) – Practice & Notes

This folder mirrors the ED “Artificial Intelligence” course topics:
- Search (UCS, A*, heuristics)
- Logic (Propositional/First-Order, inference)
- Planning (STRIPS, state-space)
- Probabilistic reasoning (Bayes nets, HMM)
- Learning (Decision trees, basic ML tie-ins)

Each subfolder contains minimal implementations + notes.
