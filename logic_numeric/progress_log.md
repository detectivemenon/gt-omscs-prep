# Progress Log — Logic + Numeric Thinking

## Day 6
**Focus:** Enumerate & Index Thinking  
- Practiced `range(start, stop, step)` and `enumerate()` for clean index control.
- Implemented manual list reversal (copy + in-place swap) for deeper loop understanding.

## Day 7
**Focus:** Collections & Aggregation  
- Computed totals and averages for list-of-lists and dictionaries.
- Learned `.items()` iteration for key–value access.
- Introduced tracking variables (`highest_avg`, `top_student`) for max-finder logic.
- Built nested dictionary loops to handle structured JSON-like data.

**Takeaway:** Strong control flow + data structure reasoning—directly applicable to ML data pipelines.
