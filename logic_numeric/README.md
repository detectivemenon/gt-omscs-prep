# Logic + Numeric Thinking (Core Python)

This folder contains clean, traditional Python implementations that exercise:
- Index reasoning (`range(start, stop, step)`, `enumerate`)
- Accumulators and counters
- Lists of lists (tabular-style data)
- Dictionaries and nested dictionaries (JSON-style data)
- Max-tracking patterns (top performer)

These are foundational skills used later in AI/ML data handling and training loops.

## Files
- `day6_indices_enumerate.py` — index control, enumerate, reverse (copy + in-place)
- `day7_list_of_lists.py` — totals and averages per row
- `day7_dicts.py` — dictionary iteration + top-performer logic
- `day7_nested_dicts.py` — nested dict aggregation, best subject, class math average

## Notes
- Code favors clarity over compact syntax (no list comprehensions; no “magical” one-liners).
- Variable names are explicit; loops are step-by-step and easy to trace.
